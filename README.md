⚠️ This project was made to test myself, and, to understand recursive backtracking a bit more⚠️

🧮Goal of this project: Create a sudoku solver algorithm using JS🧮

⚡Difficulties: storing the data, the "math" behind it, the solver algorithm itself, importing new sudokus with API-s.⚡

📗What I've learned: recursive backtracking, little bit of API calls, separating files with modules, 📗

🤖Used AI to help me: debug code, make the solving look viusally pleasing (quick sole disabled), write the css🤖
